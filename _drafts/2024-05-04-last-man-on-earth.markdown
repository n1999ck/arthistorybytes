summary: My review of the first season of The Last Man on Earth
---

I frequently go through little thought experiments in which I've found myself alone in the world. If everything beyond my house disappeared, leaving a void behind, how would I survive? If I woke up tomorrow and every other person was gone, what would I do? These scenarios are unlikely, thankfully, but give me a lot of interesting ideas to go through.

The Last Man on Earth has a simple premise: after humanity is essentially wiped out by a virus, we follow Phil Miller as he searches for other survivors. I'm not a big TV guy, but once I started the show I went through about 9 episodes in a sitting - I was hooked.

Episode 1 is a strong start. Phil drives through the United States, spray-painting billboards with "ALIVE IN TUCSON" along the way. He reaches Tucson and takes over an abandoned mansion, decorating it with stolen Rembrandts, Monets, and Van Goghs. Phil's ready for his new life.

6 months pass and Phil's struggling. He draws faces on sports balls for company, praising *Castaway* for its accuracy. The mansion fills with trash. Wallowing in a kiddie pool of tequila, Phil decides it's time to give up. But as he drives his Chevy Silverado towards a boulder face under his own spray-painted memorial, he sees a plume of smoke nearby. He veers towards it and meets Carol, the first survivor.
